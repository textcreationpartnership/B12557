            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous and Christian Reader, I had a purpoſe to haue ſeconded my firſt labour, <hi>The Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Miniſterie,</hi> in ſuch ſort as it might haue ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thine expectation, and that title at full: but partly diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by want of time and meanes fit for a worke of that waight; partly detained by hope that (as I had heard) ſome one farre more able and ancient, would eaſe me thereof, I do for the preſent, preſent thee againe with this ſermon, which as a ſupply to my former treatiſe; may ſo much further thee, (if thou take ſome ſmall paines in peruſing and conferring both that by both thou maist haue as it were one ſufficient volume of this Argument, and I the leſſe neede heereafter to labour any farther therein. If thereby I preuaile with thee ſo much that thou acknowledge the ſame for truth, and conforme thee to the practiſe, I haue a great part of my deſire: or if I may but occaſion ſome or other more learned and able to performe what I haue but rudely informed, I ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my labour not wholly loſt, I haue abounded in quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other mens obſeruations for Ornament to the
<pb facs="tcp:14325:19"/> worke, Authoritie with the learned, direction to the vnlearned, and protection for my ſelfe: which if thou vſe well, will informe thee at full, that I am neither alone, nor from the ancient, nor with the worſt.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Argument or ſubiect of my labour in this my Sermon, if any ſhall thinke it not ſo fit for the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit as the pen, let him know, There can bee no more fault in me to preach thereof, then in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Prophets, and in the Apoſtles, ſo oft, ſo much and ſo diuerſly to ſpeake and write thereof. They feared not (as <note n="*" place="margin">Rulling. Decad. lib. 5. Serm. 10.</note> one well notes of <hi>Moſes)</hi> leſt in handling that matter, they ſhould be accuſed of greedy deſire or couetouſnes: neither need I. That imputation may with better right and reaſon, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted vpon them, which after all our preaching and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of doctrine ſo neceſſary, vrged ſo oft, by ſo many, in ſo ſound and effectuall manner, as might make euen the ſtones of the ſtreet to heare, an heart of Adamant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and a brow of braſſe to bluſh at this ſinne: and for all our preaching and publiſhing of other doctrines moſt holy, moſt neceſſary, moſt ſweet, and comfortable, for which they are not able to yeeld vs ſufficient recompence with all <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.</note> that they haue, (for what are their carnall things to our ſpirituall?) Doe yet ſuffer vs to liue in all needineſſe and contempt; and making due prouiſion and ſupply for the wants of the meaneſt of themſelues, paſſe by vs as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the looking on.</p>
                  <p>Touching the meanes by which our diſtreſſes &amp; wants may be releeued, it may happily ſeeme hard or ſtrange to ſome, that I intimate the off-cutting of cuſtomes, preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, exemptions, &amp;c. But whoſo ſhall well and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider of this buſineſſe, ſhall well perceiue, that if euer there be a ſincere intent and ſetled purpoſe to effect this
<pb facs="tcp:14325:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo holy, ſo neceſſary, ſo iuſt, and ſo great a worke, it must this way, and none other be effected. For whereas our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate cannot bee bettered, but either by reſtoring vs that which indeed, and properly is our owne, which once wee had, and which was vnaduiſedly, and vniuſtly taken from vs; or elſe by allotting and beſtowing vpon vs ſome things that we neuer had. To expect the latter, that is, that we ſhould haue either ſufficient ſtypends added in all places, where need is, vnto that which we already haue, or that our gentlemen, patrones or parochians ſhould lay vs out ſo much of their fineable lands and temporall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, as might increaſe our gleeb in that meaſure, as might ſupply the want and roome of our tithes, by their cuſtomes, preſcriptions, &amp;c: which held, is neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, poſsible nor reaſonable. It reſteth therefore, that by the meanes which I haue mentioned eſpecially, this muſt, if euer, be effected. Thence is the maine cauſe of the diſeaſe and euill, and thence according to the old Maxime, <hi>Sublata cauſa, tollitur effectus,</hi> muſt come the cure and remedy: much helpe I grant may be had by <hi>Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> but neither can they wholly be restored, nor is the hurt they doe, ſo great, ſo common and generall, as of the former.</p>
                  <p>Doth it ſeeme improbable, that euer this great &amp; good worke ſhould be effected, and as a caſe deſperate, a matter paſt hope?</p>
                  <p>This may doe ſo to ſome, but to me it doth not. For firſt, when I conſider, that it is much eaſier to repaire ſome Churches, then to endow all, and yet doe perceiue that time hath beene, that all our Churches, the whole land thorough, haue beene indowed both with conuenient gleebe and <hi>their full tithes in kinde,</hi> 
                     <q>I perſwade my
<pb facs="tcp:14325:20"/> ſelfe, if we had that true zeale to the Church, and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue to religion, that the firſt Chriſtians (which ſo endowed our Churches) had, that the ruines, rents and maymes of our Churches might with facility and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough be repaired and amended: the rather for that, as in ruines and rubble of old buildings, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the place, matter conuenient and ſufficient for performance thereof.</q>

                     <p>How preciſe God was in this point, wee may not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely gather by this, that he prohibited any man ſo much <note n="e" place="margin">Leuit. 27. 33.</note> as to <hi>chaunge the tithe,</hi> a good for a bad, or a bad for a good, without a penall augmentation of it. This beeing Gods law then, ſeeing he <note n="f" place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> is the ſame God ſtill; the tithe is his right ſtill, and the vſe of them is like neceſſary ſtill, how can it be probable, that he ſhould now approoue ſuch <note n="g" place="margin">

                     <p>I will graunt (though with faire probability I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye it, and <note place="margin">Calu. in locum.</note> as ſome iudicious writers doe reſtrain that law to vowes and oblations onely) that God permitted any of his people <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. <note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 14. 24.</note> in ſome one caſe to ſell the tithe and make it in mony, and ſo to come with that mony in his hand vnto the houſe of the Lord.
